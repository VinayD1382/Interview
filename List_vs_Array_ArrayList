List : for fixed size for storing elements 
Array : fixed size of Storing element
ArrayList : we can resize the array
Then we can use List Directly why need of 
ArrayList?
Answer : List is an Interface with empty body
that insialization can be achieved through the help of 
ArrayList

List<Integer> obj = new ArrayList<>();

so thats why use Arraylist instead of only list.

Vector: similar to ArrayList but while adding new element the size
will get douuble ,that much of space will get used 
10 elements add and new one more element is adding then arraylist
creats 5 empty space for upcoming elements but Vector creates 10 more space
so if add only 11th element the 9 space in vector will be wasted 
so thats why ArrayList used instead of Vector.
