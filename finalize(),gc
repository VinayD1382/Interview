Finalize : before gc called in main method this finalize method remove all the resources of the objects : like object saved in other program and 
database that will get removed from the finalize method in java , and methid in object class in finaliz().



class Main {
    // Method to demonstrate finalize and garbage collection
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Code to run before object is garbage collected
            System.out.println("Finalize method called");
        } finally {
            super.finalize(); // Ensure that the superclass's finalize method is called
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Main
        Main obj = new Main();
        
        // Request garbage collection
        obj = null; // Make the object eligible for garbage collection
        System.gc(); // Suggest to JVM to run garbage collection
        
        // Wait to observe finalize method call (optional)
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second to allow GC to run
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }
}
